# Calculator 2.0 - This is my second at bat at building a simple calculator

So I decided to redue my calculator project from scratch because of the following:

1. I didn't like my original code implementation or user interface.
2. There were a lot of bugs and errors in the original application.
3. I wanted to test my skills and see how I have improved.

**You can view the previous calculators github repo [here](https://github.com/Davidjustice28/calculator)**

This calculator includes the same basic 5 functions - *ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, & RESET.*

## In Development

- Currently building a mode button so that users can toggle between calculator styling; dark and light.

- Support for decimals and square roots

Thank you for taking the time to review this project! I am currently seeking a frontend engineer or web developer position. If you think I could would be good fit for a role at your company, please shoot me an email at davidjustice28@gmail.com.
